# Home Detection Lab

## Overview

This project showcases a home detection lab that I built using Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) on Parrot OS and Windows environments. The lab is designed to monitor and analyze network activities, specifically focusing on detecting suspicious behavior and enhancing my cybersecurity skills through practical experience.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Elastic Stack**: Implemented Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for real-time data processing, storage, and visualization.
- **Parrot OS**: Used as a primary environment for running and managing the Elastic Stack, along with other cybersecurity tools.
- **Windows**: Deployed Windows-based virtual machines to simulate user activities and potential attack vectors.

## Lab Setup

1. **Elastic Stack**: Deployed on Parrot OS to collect and analyze data from multiple sources.
2. **Data Collection**: Configured Logstash to ingest logs from Windows and Parrot OS machines, focusing on system events, network traffic, and process monitoring.
3. **Kibana**: Utilized for creating visualizations and dashboards to monitor the lab environment and detect anomalies in real time.

## Practices and Experiments

- **Intrusion Detection**: Simulated various attack scenarios on the Windows machines and monitored them using Kibana to identify potential intrusions.
- **Nmap Scans**: Performed network scanning using Nmap and filtered the results within Kibana to practice detecting and analyzing network reconnaissance activities.
- **Process Monitoring**: Implemented process monitoring across the lab to detect suspicious processes and activities in both Windows and Parrot OS environments.

## Skills Gained

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Gained hands-on experience in setting up and configuring Elastic Stack for real-time monitoring and analysis.
- **Security Analysis**: Enhanced my ability to detect and respond to security threats through practical experiments and continuous monitoring.
- **Data Visualization**: Learned to create detailed dashboards and visualizations in Kibana to track and analyze security data effectively.

## Conclusion

This lab has significantly contributed to my understanding of cybersecurity practices, providing me with practical skills in using Elastic Stack for threat detection and analysis. By continuously refining and expanding the lab, I aim to further enhance my capabilities in cybersecurity and network monitoring.
